            <title>WAGO: Smart Script affected by Log4Shell Vulnerability</title>
            <description>Apache Log4j is used for logging events in WAGO Smart Script in Version 4.2 and higher.  Events logged by Log4j can contain JNDI references. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. Additionally, Log4j does not protect from self-referential lookups, which can lead to Denial of Service.  Remark: WAGO Smart Script 4.8.1.3 is only affected by CVE-2021-45105 and not affected by CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046.</description>

            <title>e!Cockpit – WAGO Update Package Vulnerability</title>
            <description>The firmware update package (WUP) is not signed entirely. The used password offers no additional security, it is just meant to protect from unintentional modifications of the WUP file. Thus only the integrity of the signed firmware part (rauc file) is protected against intended manipulation. An attacker could manipulate the WUP file in a way that additional files with potentially malicious content are added to the WUP file.</description>
